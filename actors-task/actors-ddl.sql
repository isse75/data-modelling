-- 1. **DDL for `actors` table:** Create a DDL for an `actors` table with the following fields:
--     - `films`: An array of `struct` with the following fields:
-- 		- film: The name of the film.
-- 		- votes: The number of votes the film received.
-- 		- rating: The rating of the film.
-- 		- filmid: A unique identifier for each film.

--     - `quality_class`: This field represents an actor's performance quality, determined by the average rating of movies of their most recent year. It's categorized as follows:
-- 		- `star`: Average rating > 8.
-- 		- `good`: Average rating > 7 and ≤ 8.
-- 		- `average`: Average rating > 6 and ≤ 7.
-- 		- `bad`: Average rating ≤ 6.
--     - `is_active`: A BOOLEAN field that indicates whether an actor is currently active in the film industry (i.e., making films this year).

CREATE TYPE films as (
		film TEXT,
		votes INTEGER,
		rating REAL,
		filmid TEXT
);

CREATE TYPE quality_class as 
	ENUM('star', 'good', 'average', 'bad')

CREATE TABLE actors (
		actorid TEXT,
		actor TEXT,
		films films[],
		quality_class quality_class,
		is_active BOOLEAN,
		PRIMARY KEY (actorid)
);
